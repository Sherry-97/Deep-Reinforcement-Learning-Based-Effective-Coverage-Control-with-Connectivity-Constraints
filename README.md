# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based-Effective-Coverage-Control-with-Connectivity-Constraints
This is the code for implementing the CCA algorithm presented in the paper: Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based-Effective-Coverage-Control-with-Connectivity-Constraints. It is configured to be run in conjunction with environments from the Multi-Agent Particle Environments (MPE)(https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs). Note:This code is based on MADDPG developed by openai, please refer to https://github.com/openai/maddpg for more detailed information(setup and run)
Known dependencies: Python (3.5.4), OpenAI gym (0.10.5), tensorflow (2.3.1), numpy (1.18.5)
